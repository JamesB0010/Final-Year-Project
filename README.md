<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project has been made open source. Therefore feel free to fork this repository and continue to build, remix or reimagine the project!

### Prerequisites


* Unity Version 2022.3.26.1f (you may upgrade if you want, although upgrading *may* introduce errors)
* Have a pair of etee controllers and dongle (controllers used to play the game)
* Blender (any version)
* Fmod studio Version 2.03.06 (if you want to edit the sounds in the game)

### Installation

How to install the project 

First copy the url of the repo from github
![Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b34c13-d946-4069-b6a6-faa9905b8724)

Next click clone repository in github desktop 
![step2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79a8d3fd-effc-45e7-b2c9-f1acba4cd128)

Enter paste the copied url into the top field and select a local folder for the repo 
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 144816](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8374c3d1-0dd3-4995-a6b5-b00a2eb0f5dd)

Once cloned open unity and select add project from disk

![Screenshot 2025-05-25 144938](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e153e7-1c1f-47cf-a878-32d1eecedb14)

Navigate to *LocalFolder*/Artefact/FYP Artefact/
It should look like this 
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 145053](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e5b3171-8ad1-4de4-9011-169fb967fcaf)

Then select add project

now you should see the project in your list of projects in unity hub. 

You can now open the project, (will take a little longer to open on the first time as unity is generating files and installing packages)

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

Firstly, I would like to thank my project supervisor Xi Guo for her continued support and investment in myself and the project. Due to your support a project has been created which I am exceptionally proud of. Secondly, I would like to thank my second supervisor Dr Liucheng Guo it has been a pleasure working with you and TG0. Additionally, thank you to the Real FLC community for providing the assets to be used in the project and thank you to the members of the unity for humanity grant
team, it is truly surreal to see the project recognised by Unity. Thank you to all my family and friends who have provided their constant love and support and thank you to all the testers who have tested the project.
